    MooseX::Role::UserDaemon - Simplify writing of user space daemons

VERSION

    version 0.05

SYNOPSIS

    In your module:

      package YourApp;
      use Moose;
      with qw(MooseX::Role::UserDaemon);
    
      # MooseX::Role::UserDaemon requires the consuming class to implement main()
      sub main {
        my ($self) = @_;
    
        # It is the responsibility of the consuming class to capture INT signals
        # to allow for graceful shutdown of the app.
        # In addition the HUP signal should be caught and used for config reload.
        my $run = 1;
        local $SIG{'INT'} = sub { $run = 0; };
    
        FOREVER_LOOP:
        while ($run) {
          ...
        }
    
        # It is recomended that main() return '0 but true' on success.
        # the return value of main is feed directly to exit()
        return '0 but true';
      }

    In your script:

      use YourApp;
      my $app = YourApp->new;
    
      exit $app->run unless caller 0;

    On the commanline:

      Start your app
      $ yourapp.pl start
        Starting...
    
      Check your status
      $ yourapp.pl status
        Running with PID: ...
    
      Stop your app
      $ yourapp.pl stop
        Stopping PID: ...

    Or preferably in combination with MooseX::SimpleConfig and/or
    MooseX::Getopt In your module:

      package YourApp;
      use Moose;
    
      # Enable use of configfile and commandline parameters as well
      with qw(MooseX::Role::UserDaemon MooseX::SimpleConfig MooseX::Getopt);
    
      # '+configfile' Only required when using MooseX::SimpleConfig
      has '+configfile' => (
        is      => 'ro',
        isa     => 'Str',
        default => sub {
          File::Spec->catdir( File::HomeDir->my_home, '.yourapp',
            'yourapp.conf' );
        },
        documentation => 'Use custom configfile.',   # Getopt use this description
      );
    
      # MooseX::Role::UserDaemon requires the consuming class to implement main()
      sub main {
        my ($self) = @_;
    
        # the user have to implement capturing signals and exiting.
        my $run = 1;
        local $SIG{'INT'} = sub { $run = 0; };
    
        FOREVER_LOOP:
        while ($run) {
          sleep 1;
        }
          
        # It is recomended that main() return '0 but true' on success.
        # the return value of main is feed directly to exit()
        return '0 but true';
      }

    In your script:

      use YourApp;
    
      # use new_with_options when using Getopt/SimpleConfig
      my $app = YourApp->new_with_options;
    
      exit $app->run unless caller 0;

    On the commanline:

      Start your app
      $ yourapp.pl start
        Starting...
    
      Check your status
      $ yourapp.pl status
        Running with PID: ...
    
      Stop your app
      $ yourapp.pl stop
        Stopping PID: ...

DESCRIPTION

    This module aims to simplify implementation of daemons and apps ment to
    be run for normal users. Not system wide services or servers.

    This module is not suited for implementing daemons running as root or
    other system users.

    When using this role your script will by default:

    1. Create a hidden folder in the users home directory with the same
    name as the script itself. So YourApp.pl will create a directory
    ~/.yourapp.pl

    2. chdir to this directory.

    3. Daemonize by double forking.

    4. Create a lockfile named lock and place a flock on the file. This
    lock will be in place until the app shuts down.

    5. Create a pidfile named pid.

    6. run the main() subroutine.

    Five commands are implemented by default: status, start, stop, restart,
    reload.

 start (default)

    Will launch the application according to the description above.

 stop

    Will read the pid from the pidfile and issue a INT signal.

 restart

    Restart is the same as running stop then start again.

 reload

    Will read the pid from the pidfile and issue a HUP signal.

 status

    Will read the pid from the pidfile and print to STDOUT.

NAME

    MooseX::Role::UserDaemon - Simplify writing of user space daemons

VERSION

    version 0.05

ATTRIBUTES

 _name

    String. Defaults to script name, is used for setting a application
    folder name.

 _valid_commands

    Regexp. Default is qr/status|start|stop|reload|restart/xms. Whitelist
    methods which can be called from the command line.

 timeout

    Integer. Default is 5. How much time in seconds it's expected to take
    after shutting down the app by sending a INT singal. This is used by
    stop to avoid waiting forever for the app to shut down.

 foreground

    Integer. Default is 0. If set to 1 the app will not daemonize/fork or
    redirect STD* to /dev/null.

 basedir

    String. Default to an application folder in the users home directory.
    The app will chdir to this location during startup. This is where we
    will place lockfile, pidfile and other application files.

 lockfile

    String. Default to /basedir/lockfile

 _lockfile_fh

    Filehandle. Used for holding the lockfile filehandle while the app is
    running.

 pidfile

    String. Default to /basedir/pid

METHODS

 run

    run() will determine which command was issued to the script, defaults
    to start if no command is given. By default the valid commands are:
    status, start, stop, restart, reload

    New commands can be added by the consuming class, it which case the
    attribute _valid_commands needs to be updated for run() to allow the
    command to be executed. _valid_commands is a RegexpRef and the default
    value is: qr/status|start|stop|reload|restart/

    You can set your own _valid_commands in the consuming class, to allow
    for custom commands like this:

      has '+_valid_commands' => (
        default => sub {
          return qr/status|start|stop|restart|custom_command/xms
        },
      );

 status

    Checks if the app is running, print status to STDOUT.

 start

    start() call main() after checking that it is not running and after
    forking (unless foreground mode is enabled).

 stop

    stop() issues a INT signal to the PID listed in the pidfile. It is up
    to the author to trap this signal and end the application in an orderly
    fashion.

 restart

    restart() simply call stop(), wait for the app to stop and call
    start().

 reload

    reload() issues a HUP signal to the PID listed in the pidfile. It is up
    to the author to trap this signal and do the appropriate thing, usualy
    to reload configuration files.
