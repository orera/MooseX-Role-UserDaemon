MooseX::Role::UserDaemon Version 0.05

DESCRIPTION

MooseX::Role::UserDaemon aims to simplify implementation of
daemons and apps ment to be run from a normal users home directory.

This module is not suited for implementing daemons running as root
or other system users.

When using this role your script will by default:

1. Create a hidden folder in the users home directory with the same
name as the script itself. So YourApp.pl will create a directory
~/.yourapp.pl

2. chdir to this directory.

3. Daemonize by double forking.

4. Create a lockfile named lock and place a flock on the file.
This lock  will be in place until the app shuts down.

5. Create a pidfile named pid.

6. run the main() subroutine.

INSTALLATION

	perl Makefile.PL
